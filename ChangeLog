-----------------------------------
Version 1.16b (based on afl 2.43b):
-----------------------------------

  - Fixed an issue with Intel PT mode where target processes were not
    terminated properly.
    Reported by Jason Shirk
    
  - Added a port of afl-analyze

    DynamoRIO 7.1
 
----------------------------------
Version 1.16 (based on afl 2.43b):

----------------------------------
Version 1.15 (based on afl 2.43b):
----------------------------------

  - Added -p flag which persists DynamoRIO cache across process restarts.
    This might have a slight positive impact on performance in some scenarios,
    such as where WinAFL persistece can't be used effectively, or
    with very complex targets.

  - Fix custom_net_fuzzer to avoid consuming system resources by
    unclosed sockets.

    This currently comes with (experimental) network fuzzing implementation
    (both server- and client- side)
    Contributed by Maksim Shudrak

  - New "In App Persistence" mode that relaxes target_method restrictions
    if the target process can be made to loop on its own
    Contributed by Guy Inbar
    
  - Implemented setup_post on Windows
    Contributed by Quang Nguyễn

  - Added separate timeout for process initialization and the first run
    Contributed by Netanel Ben Simon

    Contributed by yoava333

  - Fixed a bug in load_extra that could cause errors or incorrect behavior when reading extras directory

Version 1.04 (based on afl 1.96b):
----------------------------------

  Various fixes / improvements contributed by Axel "0vercl0k" Souchet:
  - Mute stdout/stderr unless AFL_NO_SINKHOLE env variable is set.
  - Allow several slaveless instances to be run on the same machine.
  - Fix getopt to properly handle options without parameters.
  - Automatically remove the child pid file.
  - Case insensitive module name comparison.
  - More debugging messages.

----------------------------------
Version 1.03 (based on afl 1.96b):
----------------------------------

  - Fixed dictionary loading.
	Reported by Hugo Meier.

----------------------------------
Version 1.02 (based on afl 1.96b):
----------------------------------

  - Fixed incorrect quoting of target command line arguments.

  - Debug mode now reports encountered exceptions.

----------------------------------
Version 1.01 (based on afl 1.96b):
----------------------------------

  - Fixed a bug where previous offset wasn't updated in the edge coverage
    instrumentation mode. This effectively caused edge coverage to behave
	the same as basic block coverage.
	Reported by Rodrigo Axel Monroy.

  - Changed the default coverage mode to basic block in order for the default
    configuration to work better with muti-threaded apps.

  - Added -no_follow_children to DR runtime flags. This can fix problems if the
    target process creates a child process.

  - More data in now written to the debug log

----------------------------------
Version 1.00 (based on afl 1.96b):
----------------------------------

  - Initial release.
