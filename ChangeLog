Version 1.04 (based on afl 1.96b):
----------------------------------

  Various fixes / improvements contributed by Axel "0vercl0k" Souchet:
  - Mute stdout/stderr unless AFL_NO_SINKHOLE env variable is set.
  - Allow several slaveless instances to be run on the same machine.
  - Fix getopt to properly handle options without parameters.
  - Automatically remove the child pid file.
  - Case insensitive module name comparison.
  - More debugging messages.

----------------------------------
Version 1.03 (based on afl 1.96b):
----------------------------------

  - Fixed dictionary loading.
	Reported by Hugo Meier.

----------------------------------
Version 1.02 (based on afl 1.96b):
----------------------------------

  - Fixed incorrect quoting of target command line arguments.

  - Debug mode now reports encountered exceptions.

----------------------------------
Version 1.01 (based on afl 1.96b):
----------------------------------

  - Fixed a bug where previous offset wasn't updated in the edge coverage
    instrumentation mode. This effectively caused edge coverage to behave
	the same as basic block coverage.
	Reported by Rodrigo Axel Monroy.

  - Changed the default coverage mode to basic block in order for the default
    configuration to work better with muti-threaded apps.

  - Added -no_follow_children to DR runtime flags. This can fix problems if the
    target process creates a child process.

  - More data in now written to the debug log
